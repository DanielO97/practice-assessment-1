as Foundations project I want to set up an online store.
The store should display several categories of products that will be sold there and the products listings. In addition, there will be a blog about the products that we will be selling and our contact information. Also , i want to create a database where registered customer's information will be stored. 

At this stage I developed the first page of the store (not completely). Mainly I worked on it Mon-Wed and was planning to complete the tasks like (linking several pages together, using media queries and finish with all html and css) on weekend, so that I can move on to javascript and database) for next week. However, things took me longer than expected. Fixing bugs even with developer tools took me a while. I was very frustrated when my boxes weren't allocated as I wanted, only because of one exra or missing <div> (or if it is in a wrong place), fascinating how a small issue can have a huge impact visually. Apart from that , I wanted everything to look "perfect" and therefore instead of proceeding, and fixing small issues at a later strage, I was getting stuck on those issues, that resulted in a lot of frustration and slow progress. next time i ll do things differently.  I didn't finish everything I had to, but I will finish media quieries thing and html and css of two more pages within the next 2 days. 

I must say that overall, if I compare my knowledge of html and css now with my knowledge exactly one week ago - I feel huge improvement. The time that I invested into this was up to 15h (watching materials, reading and actually working on the hand-ing). I hope that such feeling of improvement will last for following weeks as I dedicate 15h for this weekly. 

I've learned that i prefer firefox' developer tools than chrome's. much better user experience.
With this assessment I rewised all the knowledge I had previously(i took foundations in ss2020 but didn't do the assessment) and I feel much more confident this time than back in 2020. by all knowledge i meant the most basic info (like general html structure, creating links, main css properties and tags)
Another important note is that I should always be very attentive with what I put inside my containers/divs. generally this parent-child properties thing.
